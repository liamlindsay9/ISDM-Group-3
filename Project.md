### POV Statements 

**In-bound Customers**
- As an inbound customer i want a comprehensive call exchange system which is fast so that i can make informed decisions and have quicker service. 

**Relationship Manager(MR)**
- As a relationship manager I want a call management system that is quick, effective and efficient so I can sell as many products as fast as possible. 

**Out-bount Customer**
- As a potentially interested buyer, I want incoming calls about products to be quick and effective. I don’t want to be stuck on the phone for long periods of time for a product I’m not interested in.
