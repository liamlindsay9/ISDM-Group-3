# ISDM Group 2 Project - Call Management Centre(CMC) System

## Defining the Problem - Design Thinking Methodologies
### Empathy Maps
- We used Empathy Maps as part of our Design Thinking Process on order to explore and understand how our stakeholders may think feel towards a new system. This allowed us to understand what boundries and factors we will have to consider on a personal level when designing the CMC system.

### POV Statements 
- We used POV statements to capture and better understand what it is that each stakeholder needed to gain from the system and what problem the system would solve for them respectively.

**In-bound Customers**
- As an inbound customer i want a comprehensive call exchange system which is fast so that i can make informed decisions and have quicker service. 

**Relationship Manager(MR)**
- As a relationship manager I want a call management system that is quick, effective and efficient so I can sell as many products as fast as possible. 

**Out-bount Customer**
- As a potentially interested buyer, I want incoming calls about products to be quick and effective. I don’t want to be stuck on the phone for long periods of time for a product I’m not interested in.
